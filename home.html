        <h2>About KTM</h2><br>
        <br>
        <P>
            KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s, it has expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars – namely the X-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many street as off-road bikes.[6]
        From 2012, KTM was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe for four consecutive years.[7][8] Globally, the company is among the leading off-road motorcycle manufacturers.[9][10] In 2016, KTM sold 203,423 motor vehicles worldwide.[11] In 2012, KTM won the
        Moto3 manufacturers' championship. During the next season, KTM riders prevailed in every race of the Moto3 class and won the world title as well as second and third place, making KTM the obvious victor of the manufacturers' standing. KTM won the manufacturer t-
        tle in the 2014 and 2016 as well as the world title in 2016 in the Moto3 class. Starting in 2017, KTM fields bikes in both MotoGP and Moto2 classes as well. The main class team features Bradley Smith and Pol Espargaró as full-season riders, and Mika Kallio as w
        ildcard rider. The Moto2 KTM Ajo team features Miguel Oliveira and Brad Binder. Steadfastly independent and confident of their company's abilities, KTM chose to use a steel trellis frame where all other manufacturers used aluminum. In addition, KTM insisted on  
        developing their own racing suspension through their WP subsidiary (all other manufacturers used Öhlins). KTM demonstrated their prowess in doing things their own way by winning their first Moto GP premier class race on August 9, 2020, with rookie Brad Binder cr
        ossing the finish line in first place.
