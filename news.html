              <H3>2023 KTM 390 ADVENTURES SPOKE WHEEL INDIA LAUNCH</H3><BR>
                  <H4>WHAT HARDCORE DOES THE KTM 390 WIRE SPOKE USED IN IT</H4><BR>
                      <P>
                          This motorcycle comes equipped with spoked wheels and black anodized aluminium rims instead of alloy units on the lower versions. These retain the 19-inch front and 17-inch rear combination. However, unlike the alloy wheels, the wire-spoke units are wrapped in tube tyres. This variant also benefits from an updated suspension setup that comprises adjustable front forks and a rear monoshock. The front forks feature compression (30 clicks) and rebound (30 clicks) adjustability, while the rear monoshock is rebound (20 clicks) and preload (10-step) adjustable. Meanwhile, the travel rating for the front forks and rear monoshock is rated at 170mm and 177mm, respectively. On the other hand, the braking setup remains unaltered, and this variant of the KTM 390 Adventure retains a 320mm front disc and 230mm single discs with Bybre-sourced callipers.

              <H4>WHAT DOES THE FEATURES KTM 390 HAS </H4><BR>
                  <P>The feature list is identical to the standard 390 Adventure. Thus, the Wire Spoke Wheel variant, too, gets full-LED lighting, a colour TFT display with Bluetooth connectivity, riding modes, a traction control system, cornering ABS, off-road ABS, a quick-shifter, and ride-by-wire throttle.The overall design remains unaltered, and the 2023 KTM 390 Adventure continues to feature a split-style headlight, rally-style windscreen, a muscular shape for the fuel tank, split-style seats, two-piece pillion grab rail, and a side-slung exhaust. However, the wire-spoke wheels enhance the rugged looks of the motorcycle while the bold graphics distinguish it from the rest of the 390 Adventure variants. It is available in a single paint option â€“ Rally Orange. This paint theme brings an orange base paint to the motorcycle, an orange colour to the chassis, and a blacked out rear-subframe.The mechanical specifications are identical across the 390 Adventure range. Thus, the 2023 KTM 390 Adventure retains the 373.27cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled motor that delivers a maximum output of 42.9bhp at 9,000rpm and 37Nm of peak torque at 7,000rpm. This engine is linked to a six-speed gearbox.</P>
