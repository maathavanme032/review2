    <h2>About KTM</h2><br>
    <br>
    <P>
        KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s, it has expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars – namely the X-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many street as off-road bikes.[6]
    From 2012, KTM was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in Europe for four consecutive years.[7][8] Globally, the company is among the leading off-road motorcycle manufacturers.[9][10] In 2016, KTM sold 203,423 motor vehicles worldwide.[11] In 2012, KTM won the
    Moto3 manufacturers' championship. During the next season, KTM riders prevailed in every race of the Moto3 class and won the world title as well as second and third place, making KTM the obvious victor of the manufacturers' standing. KTM won the manufacturer t-
    tle in the 2014 and 2016 as well as the world title in 2016 in the Moto3 class. Starting in 2017, KTM fields bikes in both MotoGP and Moto2 classes as well. The main class team features Bradley Smith and Pol Espargaró as full-season riders, and Mika Kallio as w
    ildcard rider. The Moto2 KTM Ajo team features Miguel Oliveira and Brad Binder. Steadfastly independent and confident of their company's abilities, KTM chose to use a steel trellis frame where all other manufacturers used aluminum. In addition, KTM insisted on  
    developing their own racing suspension through their WP subsidiary (all other manufacturers used Öhlins). KTM demonstrated their prowess in doing things their own way by winning their first Moto GP premier class race on August 9, 2020, with rookie Brad Binder cr
    ossing the finish line in first place.

    <H3>2023 KTM 390 ADVENTURES SPOKE WHEEL INDIA LAUNCH</H3><BR>
        <H4>WHAT HARDCORE DOES THE KTM 390 WIRE SPOKE USED IN IT</H4><BR>
            <P>
                This motorcycle comes equipped with spoked wheels and black anodized aluminium rims instead of alloy units on the lower versions. These retain the 19-inch front and 17-inch rear combination. However, unlike the alloy wheels, the wire-spoke units are wrapped in tube tyres. This variant also benefits from an updated suspension setup that comprises adjustable front forks and a rear monoshock. The front forks feature compression (30 clicks) and rebound (30 clicks) adjustability, while the rear monoshock is rebound (20 clicks) and preload (10-step) adjustable. Meanwhile, the travel rating for the front forks and rear monoshock is rated at 170mm and 177mm, respectively. On the other hand, the braking setup remains unaltered, and this variant of the KTM 390 Adventure retains a 320mm front disc and 230mm single discs with Bybre-sourced callipers.
            </P><BR>
    <H4>WHAT DOES THE FEATURES KTM 390 HAS </H4><BR>
        <P>The feature list is identical to the standard 390 Adventure. Thus, the Wire Spoke Wheel variant, too, gets full-LED lighting, a colour TFT display with Bluetooth connectivity, riding modes, a traction control system, cornering ABS, off-road ABS, a quick-shifter, and ride-by-wire throttle.The overall design remains unaltered, and the 2023 KTM 390 Adventure continues to feature a split-style headlight, rally-style windscreen, a muscular shape for the fuel tank, split-style seats, two-piece pillion grab rail, and a side-slung exhaust. However, the wire-spoke wheels enhance the rugged looks of the motorcycle while the bold graphics distinguish it from the rest of the 390 Adventure variants. It is available in a single paint option – Rally Orange. This paint theme brings an orange base paint to the motorcycle, an orange colour to the chassis, and a blacked out rear-subframe.The mechanical specifications are identical across the 390 Adventure range. Thus, the 2023 KTM 390 Adventure retains the 373.27cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled motor that delivers a maximum output of 42.9bhp at 9,000rpm and 37Nm of peak torque at 7,000rpm. This engine is linked to a six-speed gearbox.</P>
